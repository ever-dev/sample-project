## Sample Project:

For your sample project, we would like you to build a "create-school" flow.

The designs for the component are here:

Please note the following:

- Clicking "create school" opens the flow. The flow opens full-screen over the existing page (a modal). 

- Break the flow into components and organize as you see fit.

- There is no backend. Do not worry about file uploads, validations, etc. 

- All fields the user inputted can be logged to the console after the final step.

- Use react-bootstrap (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). This is already pulled into the project.

- Screens:
    - 1: Timezone is dropdown. All other fields are text.
    - 2: Fields can be text for now
    - 3: Fields can be text for now

- Timebox to 3 hours maximum. Complete what you have time to.

- When you're complete, please make a PR which we can review.
